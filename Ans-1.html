1.	Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

        => HTML tags and elements are not the same thing.

	HTML tags :
          
        => HTML tags are the beginning and ending part of HTML elements.
           Ex : <body> </body> , <a> </a> , <img> , <hr>

	HTML elements :

        => The content in the middle of HTML tag is called HTML element.
           Ex : <title> Welcome to our website </title>
                The text you can see in the middle (welcome to our website) is known as the element.
